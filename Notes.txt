Variables and Data Types
const = can't be re-assigned a value and can't be declared again  (block scope)
let = can be re-assigned a value but can't be declared again (block scope)
var = it can be re-assigned a value and it can also be declared again  (Global scope)

=> Never use var in your code instead of let because of block and functional scope issues.
# console.table([group of variables you want to show in tabular form])

const 
    JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared
    Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared
    Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned
    Variables defined with const have Block Scope
    Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

//  Prefer not to use use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope

let
    Variables declared with let have Block Scope
    Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
    Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope
